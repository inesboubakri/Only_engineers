- Investment information
- Data for charts and visualizations

### 🧩 View

The view consists of:
- `dashboard.html`: Main markup structure for the interface
- `styles.css`: Styling for both light and dark themes, layout, and responsive design

### 🧩 Controller

The `dashboardController.js` connects the model and view:
- Initializes the dashboard
- Handles theme switching
- Manages data flow between the model and view

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- ⚡ **Real-time data updates**: Implement WebSocket connections to provide live financial data without requiring page refreshes. This would include real-time balance updates, instant transaction notifications, and live market data for investments.

- 🔐 **User authentication**: Add secure login functionality with multi-factor authentication, user roles (admin/regular user), and personalized dashboard settings. This will include session management and secure password handling.

- 📈 **More detailed financial analytics**: Develop advanced analytics tools including expense categorization, spending patterns identification, budget forecasting, and customizable time-period comparisons (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

- 📊 **Additional chart visualizations**: Integrate more interactive chart types such as candlestick charts for investments, heat maps for spending categories, and customizable comparison charts to track financial goals against actual performance.

- 🔍 **Transaction filtering and searching**: Create advanced filtering capabilities allowing users to search transactions by date range, amount, category, and keywords. Include the ability to export filtered results to CSV/PDF formats for reporting.
